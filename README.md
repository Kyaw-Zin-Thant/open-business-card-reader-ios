Open Business Card Reader for iOS
================

An open source implementation of FullContact Card Reader.

## Requirements

Open Business Card Reader requires [iOS 7.0](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS7.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013162-SW1) or above.

### ARC

This project uses ARC.

If you are using Open Business Card Reader in your non-arc project, you will need to set a `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag on all of the source files. 

To set a compiler flag in Xcode, go to your active target and select the "Build Phases" tab. Now select all Open Buisness Card Reader source files, press Enter, insert `-fobjc-arc` and then "Done" to enable ARC.
